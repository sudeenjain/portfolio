* **Dynamic Three.js Background:** A unique, interactive 3D particle animation runs in the background for an immersive experience.
* **Modular Structure:** The project is split into multiple HTML fragments (`includes/`), CSS (`css/style.css`), and JavaScript files (`js/particles.js`, `js/scripts.js`) for easy management.
* **Responsive Layout:** Fully optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
* **Scroll Animations:** Uses the **AOS (Animate On Scroll)** library to bring elements to life as the user scrolls.
